Python Personal Finance Tracker
The provided Python code is a personal finance tracker that allows users to record and analyze their income and expenses. The application uses a CSV file to store transaction data, including the date, amount, category (Income or Expense), and an optional description. Users can add new transactions, and the application will append these to the CSV file. The application also provides a feature to view transactions within a specific date range, summarizing the total income, total expense, and net spend. Additionally, it can plot the income and expenses over time, providing a visual representation of the user's financial activities. The application is interactive, with a menu-driven system in the main function that allows users to choose between adding a transaction, viewing transactions, or exiting the program.
